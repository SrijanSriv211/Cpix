We intend for this to be a minimally invasive change that will enable us to provide the best tools to our users. In response to your comments, we are providing the following changes and points of clarification:\nDNT and self-help browser extensions\nCommenters raised questions about our language on DNT and self-help browser extensions. We've pushed a commit that:\n• Folds the existing DNT and browser extension information into a new section on disabling non-essential cookies.\n• Specifies there will be a user setting to disable non-essential cookies and provides additional details to clarify which cookies will be used and for what reasons.\n• Specifies that DNT will be honored on GitHub, and that if a DNT signal is sent, GitHub will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies, so that we do not have to rely on third parties honoring DNT.\n• Browsers' built-in tracking protection has advanced significantly in recent years, so we've noted that configuring that built-in protection may block non-essential cookies.\n• Separated mentions of browser extensions designed to block tracking, and extensions designed to block unwanted content with the effect of blocking tracking, for clarity, though using either alone or in combination may block non-essential cookies.\n• Changed links with additional information on DNT and browser extensions to point to their respective Wikipedia articles for neutrality, currency, and to clarify that these are not GitHub products (though of course we're proud that many privacy protection tools are developed on GitHub).\nFinally, some have asked why we’re explaining technical self-help tools. GitHub has a very broad user base, including new developers – and we want everyone to be informed about the scope of their options, including technical options.\nEnterprise user experience\nCommenters asked for clarification about how this change will impact the enterprise user experience. We are introducing cookies on GitHub’s Enterprise Marketing Pages (e.g. resources.github.com), not on Enterprise user accounts. We intend for this change to make it easier for our Marketing team to better understand the needs of users who are visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages and connect them with the solutions that will benefit them most.\nUsers who visit these pages will have the option to express their cookies preferences by navigating to the link in the footer of the page.\nStylistic change\nCommenters have asked why ‘Personal Data’ was changed to ‘personal data’ in the Privacy Statement update. We made personal data lowercase because it is not a defined term in our Terms of Service, for consistency with “All capitalized terms have their definition in GitHub’s Terms of Service, unless otherwise noted here.” The stylistic change does not impact its definition.",
